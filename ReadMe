To access the streaming URLs, you can use:

http://<your-vps-ip>:3000/stream/<id>/master.mpd
http://<your-vps-ip>:3000/stream/<id>/master.m3u8
Replace <id> with the index of the URL you added.

Note
Make sure to secure your VPS and consider using a process manager like PM2 to keep your app running in the background. You may also want to implement validation for the URLs you accept and add error handling to enhance the robustness of your application.
